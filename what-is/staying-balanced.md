# How to Stay Balanced

Allopathic Medicines including mood stabilizers and antipsychotics in small doses to keep enough chemical pressure to reduce the energy to manageable level but not make a person completely drowsy and dysfunctional.  As said we believe in harm reduction and not force antipsychotic medications which cause benumbing and excessive somnolence.  All antipsychotics and antidepressants impair mitochondrial function thus decreasing the energy function.

# Ayurveda

Ayurveda Treatments including Takradhara (medicated buttermilk on the forehead) and Shirodhara (medicated oil on the forehead) to balance the Vatta in the body and Abhyanga (oil massage) and Sweda(steam) to maintain the energies  in balance.
  
There's extensive literature on the benefits of these therapies for balance of spiritual energies during the non ordinary states of consciousness or manic highs.  
There are well established centers and systems to help in this regard.

# Gut-Brain Health

Balancing the Microbiome using Prebiotics such as Spirulina and Fermented foods is essential.

Balanced fresh  and hot meals are essential to establishing a balance in the gut-microbiome axis.  We are essentially walking, talking thinking bacteria. Ninety percent of serotonin and majority of dopamine both very important neurotransmitters in mental health are produced in the gut!
 
It's very essential that you keep your bowels moving and that you're not constipated!!! All psychiatric medications tend to produce constipation!

[Fermented Rice or any other Fermented Foods and Pre/Probiotics such as Spirulina 6-8 grams per day along with balanced diet!]

[Here's a link](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1853/the-brain-gut-and-consciousness-microbiology-of-our-mind) which describes how we are "Holobionts" and that the gut-brain-micro biome axis is the very basis of our consciousness.

Psychosocial support is extremely important to be with people who believe in you.  

Stay Creative whether it's by writing, art, cooking or gardening
