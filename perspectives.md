# Imran - Handi-capable

What I, Imran think about my "mental illness" and Vishwas Peer Support Group.

The word spiritual either scares or confuses most people. There is a [Divine] Law of Evolution guiding things. Interventions happen though they seem to be random but if we look closely, there is a synchronicity.

To me, any revelation or expansion in love and understanding is a spiritual occurrence.

As an Aurobindonian, I believe as Satprem and Vrekhem have stated, that we are on the verge of evolving into something beyond man. This means that our current way of being, thinking, living needs to change. When the change happens faster than the body mind complex can effect, they breakdown and ailments or mental illness occurs.

In my own case, a steady build-up of Sattvik energy, 3 years after I had done the brainsync.com meditations, followed by a lack of job and boundless energy caused me to build so much momentum that ideas started flooding in too fast.

Immature in planning and handling expectations, I would, as a Dr pointed out, "overspill" or "spill in the wrong direction". Today, this symptom still occurs when my sleep is not under control.

I have enough faith in the journey to not regret the learnings I have had, but I need people to recognise that I am different and need some encouragement.

Here is [a video I made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGk1PWeiHco) a few days after my 2022 Sep episode.

Later, I will add these:

* Imran in Summation
* Beyond Man
* Normalcy
* The Gag Order
* Finding Peace
